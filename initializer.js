    		q: "How are points calculated?",
    		a: "Points are based on Pony Up odds of a team winning a division. The more unlikely a team is to win the division/wildcard at the time of the pick, the more points that pick is worth if it ends up being correct."	
    	},
    	{
    		q: "Do I make different picks for each league I'm in?",
    		a: "No. You can join as many leagues as you want, but only have to make one set of picks (that set of picks will be automaticall entered in each league)"

    	{
    		q: "Does it matter what week I join?",
    		a: "You can join in any week. However, because picks from each week are eligible to score points, those that enter leagues late are at a disadvantage."
